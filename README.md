Edgy Theme
==================
Sublime Edgy Theme - loosely based on the Adobe implementation of Brackets (http://brackets.io/).

I find this theme a little cleaner than the big curvy sublime tabs. Also, I also prefer the sidebar to be simple and clean.

The theme looks best with a light code colour scheme - however it will still work with dark themes.
