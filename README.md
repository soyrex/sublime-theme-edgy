Edgy Theme for Sublime Text 2
=============================
Sublime Edgy Theme - loosely based on the Adobe implementation of Brackets (http://brackets.io/). Credit to Domenico Carbotta for creating the IDLE theme, which was used as a basis for this theme.

I find this theme a little cleaner than the big curvy sublime tabs. Also, I also prefer the sidebar to be simple and clean.

The theme looks best with a light code colour scheme - however it will still work with dark themes.

Installation
------------
Basically: clone the git repo into your Packages folder for Sublime - then in your preferences, set the theme to Edgy - i also include a colour scheme - which is basically the IDLE one (with possibly a couple of modifications - again credit to Domenico Carbotta). So in your general preferences you'll need something like:

	"color_scheme": "Packages/sublime-theme-edgy/Edgy.tmTheme",
	"theme": "Edgy.sublime-theme"

Note 
-----
I have my Sublime set up with tabs on and the sidebar visible. I hide the minimap - it's not really useful ;).
